# Introduction

Here is a link to the [gitlab repo](https://gitlab.com/armoredblood/makerspace-code-of-conduct) is you would like to take a look.

During my time as a director of a non-profit makerspace, I started to hear rumblings of talk and actions that don't reflect what we stand for as an organization. There have been instances were a member has disrespected another member, talk that disrespects certain groups of people, and so on. I decided that my first major action as President was to create and add a Code of Conduct to our organizations bylaws.

Until this point, our only guideline was "Don't be a jerk", which works when your organization is still small and everyone knows each other intimately. However, as the organization grows, it gets to a point where you don't know everyone as well as you did, and what constitutes being a "jerk" becomes more objective and based on the individual. 

The requirements for this new Code of Conduct is as follows:
* Clear and concise guidelines on acceptable behavior of members
* Generic to not be tied to a specific makerspace, but for any shared creative workspace
* List protected classes
* Contain a section on safety
* List action items for Directors if a report is made to them
* Open source and source-controllable for an audit trail of changes

I borrowed the majority of the wording from the very well written [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) which was originally meant for open source code projects. I modified some wording to apply to a physical creative workspace.

I also added a section on basic physical safety.

One important piece that I added to the protected classes was "skill level" and "chosen craft" which I thought was needed as I've heard of people disrespecting a certain way of doing things (based on experience) or craft (ex: using a cnc router vs. hand tools)
