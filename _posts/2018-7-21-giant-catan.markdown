# Introduction
I made this because I wanted it and it didn't exist. I saw some people with giant chess or giant checkers to play as a yard game during cookouts, but as a board game enthusiast, I wanted something a bit more up my alley.

All pieces were designed in the open source vector graphics software Inkscape.

The tiles are a little over 2ft across each, cut out of 3/4" plywod, with a small 1/8" pocket routed out of the center. They were painted with exterior grade paint according to their resource type.

The markers are laser cut and engraved cast acrylic about 6" in diameter. They correspond to the exact same markers as in the game.

The game pieces are lasercut 1/4" plywood.
