# Introduction
This was a quick project I threw together to monitor the makerspace's front door. We have a membership tier that doesn't provide 24x7 access, but allows them to come in whenever a full member is present. This sensor pinged a channel on our Slack workspace to notify members when the space's front door was unlocked. It also helped us officers realize when the door was left open!
